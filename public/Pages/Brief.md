## Your mission, if you choose to accept it...

is to help developers make the right decisions when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Let me fill you in.

Artificial intelligence is a broad field invoking thought of the Terminator or AUTO from Pixar's WALL-E. As such, it can be rather difficult to give it a specific definition.
But for all intents and purposes, think of it as any way to enable algorithms to 'think'. This means analyzing tons of data, and using it to make decisions.

If AI is about teaching computers to 'think', then you can think of the field of _computer vision_ as teaching them how to 'see'. This means the data it analyzes is picture and video.

While computer vision is an equally broad field, and still feels cutting edge, many now use it every day to unlock their iPhones.

In addition, computer vision specifically is finding its use in more and more industries, from automotive to investigative.

So follow me as we try to determine how (if at all) developers can make their computer vision AI, the right way.
We'll analyze the scenario though a few lenses, and we'll make a note of the takeaways for each section.

Besides, I just saw these videos, and really want to try out some of the tactics here anyhow.

So let's get to work!
