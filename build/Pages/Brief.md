## What steps have to be taken to ensure computer vision is used ethically?

The short answer is, of course, it's complicated. What I hope to do here though, is to learn from others' experience; that is, to see how others have made the right decisions
(and the wrong ones) when it comes to ths form of artificial intelligence.

Let me fill you in.

Artificial intelligence is a broad field invoking thought of the Terminator or Pixar's WALL-E. As such, it can be rather difficult to give it a specific definition.
For our intents and purposes, though, we think of it as any way to enable algorithms to 'think'. This means analyzing tons of data, and using it to make decisions.

If traditional AI is about teaching computers to 'think', then you can think of the field of _computer vision_ as teaching them how to 'see'. This means the data it analyzes is picture and video instead of numbers and letters.

While computer vision is an equally broad field, and still feels cutting edge, many now use it every day to unlock their iPhones.

In addition, computer vision specifically is finding its use in more and more industries, from automotive to investigative.

So follow me as we try to determine how (if at all) developers can make their computer vision AI, well... good[^1].
We'll analyze the scenario though a few lenses, and we'll make a note of the takeaways for each section.

Before we head off though, I'd like to introduce the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and
Professional Practice (SECEPP)[^2]. This is exactly what it says on the tin; a widely used set of "do"s and "don't"s for software engineers to follow.
Now I won't quote it explicitly and of course, it is not exhaustive, nor all encompassing, but is a good guiding philosophy, especially if we're getting into the mindset of a developer. Here are the clauses I'm going to focus on.

- 1.03 Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public good.
- 1.07 Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and other factors that can diminish access to the benefits of software.
- 3.10 Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review of software and related documents on which they work.
- 3.13 Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means, and use it only in ways properly authorized.

So let's get to work!
