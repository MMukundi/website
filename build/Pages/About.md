## Hi! I'm Marcel

I'm a senior at WSU (Go Cougs!) with a passion for STEM, eduction, and STEM education.
When given a chance to work on a project over a semester, I used the chance to study a technology I knew next to nothing about.

As I read, I couldn't help but feel that this information wanted to be shared, but was stuck under layers of linear algebra.

So, I made this! A more grounded and (hopefully) intuitive look through a growing technology, and what it does/could mean for us as consumers. I really hope that you learned something interesting or, at least, saw some interesting pictures :)

### Thanks for reading!
